If your brain is not working properly, how can yo work?

We need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.

So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)

1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.

2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.

3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.

4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness."

I explained that I could understand what she was going through because of my own experiences with anxiety and depression. My coworkers were all very understanding and it didn’t seem to change their behaviour with me., As I said above, I have a coworker who is having real difficulty coping with anxiety and their work. I have had brief conversations with several other coworkers about this person’s situation, as they are currently getting inpatient treatment for it and I’m the person on the team who knows them best. People are all very sensitive and worried about them. One coworker told me that although he worries about them, he can’t really understand what their troubles are and what they feel like, because he’s never had that experience himself. I considered trying to explain but didn’t think I would be able to., It went horribly. I was a PhD student and disclosed to my supervisors that I was suffering from depression and anxiety but was seeing a therapist and taking steps to feel better. (This was partly related to the poor progress of my project, and their supervision style.) They said they understood but treated me with a very kid-gloves approach for a few weeks, then demanded to ask mu therapist questions about me. Eventually I agreed to let them send their questions to an HR person, who would act as an intermediary between them and the therapist. They wanted to know if I was a danger to myself or others. The therapist replied that I was not. My supervisors then told me that the therapist’s answer showed that my illness was no excuse for the poor state of my project. They put me on a ten-week ‘improvement plan’ that was logically impossible to succeed at, and then pushed me out of the PhD studentship., Please see my answer above to the question about talking to a previous employer about a mental health disorder., Take it as seriously as physical health support."

I have also resigned due to mental health (and in one case, returned later)., Mostly supportive. People either reveal their own mental health struggles (surprisingly common) or try to understand. Sometimes I end up feeling worse if I can tell they are struggling themselves but act like they've got it all together and seem determined not to show weakness. I've also occasionally had people become very uncomfortable and then withdraw from the relationship., One manager told me about her bipolar disorder. She was a huge support to me at the time., Co-worker was bullied by manager and ended up taking stress leave. She had to hand in her laptop before her leave and give her password to the bullying manager. It was appalling, and was supported by HR and the executives. As a person who had previously revealed mental health problems (and had stood up for my co-worker), I knew I could no longer stay at the company and resigned shortly after., Where do I start? Stop overworking people, be more open to 4-day work weeks, give people more control over their deliverables, get serious about stopping bullying, stop rewarding unhealthy behaviour such as extreme competitiveness and overwork.

People closer in my rank were supportive and excited., Once I was open with my struggles, others opened up to me. I have coworkers tell me about their past struggles with suicidal thoughts, depression and dealing with people dying by suicide close to them. I listened, supported and when necessary encouraged them to seek counseling or other professional help., I had a mental health break down while I was working at my previous employer (food and beverage). I told them I was quitting and instead said I could take the time I needed and come back when I was ready. , I talked about my substance use disorder, depression, and anxiety., Judging and talking behind my back, not thinking I am able to handle a task because of it, The industry can discuss mental health - have conversations and end stigma. Also, boundaries need to be set in tech industries from the first interview. A job description with distinct responsibilities and roles should be a must. Pay should be respectful. The bullying and gossiping must stop. , Sexism in the tech industry is real. This affects mental health and should be address. "

He was very supportive, telling me to take the time I needed to get things sorted out, and let me cry in his office.

I felt very supported and safe., I've mentioned that I have mental illness and am in therapy, and they have always been very supportive.

Once I had to advocate for myself in regards to my anxiety, and they were very accommodating. They related to what I was telling them and asked some questions to understand., A coworker once confided in me about some struggles he was going through with his depression, and we talked about it together and went over some strategies. I mostly just listened and gave him support., When first entering treatment for my eating disorder I told my boss that I was taking the day off for a medical intake. She asked what kind of intake.

I wasn't really comfortable talking about it with her, but told her anyway because I was worried it would look badly to not share.

She became very awkward and stiff., At one job I told a coworker about how the work was negatively affecting my mental health. She was very concerned and encouraged me to reach out to my boss/HR and to seek help. She was very supportive, even if the environment we were in was not., -better awareness of what individuals can do to support mental health (and alternatively how things they do can negatively affect mental health)

To recognize when they are working long hours, and sending high demands with no space for air/time off. The boss sets the culture and if they continue to just say ""take care of yourself"" but don't make the actions for their team to do so or for their selves to do so, nothing will change. And to make sure the support resources available to them are actually working. That employees know where to go, can afford them and enjoy the care provided. I see to often money being thrown at services that are not properly audited or communicated to the team., Just as an fyi, I work for a tech - mental health company. Which is a big reason the beginning of the survey is so positive. We are a startup though so we do have grind times, with high stress and low sleep but have made sure we practice what we preach which is amazing."

It made me feel better that I wasn't alone in what I was experiencing but also more determined to not look to medication for a solution., A colleague once told me that they had almost committed suicide on the way to work that morning when they were crossing a bridge. It came as a complete shock to me to learn that they had been dealing with depression for longer than I had known them (6+ years) and such thoughts were a regular occurrence for them but this was the first time they had acted upon them. If it hadn't been for the intervention of a passerby they would have thrown themselves into the river., A colleague who had just volunteered the fact that they almost ended their life on the way to work was basically told ""Well you're here now so you might as well get on with the job."", Take an active interest in the person and tailor the approach to the needs of the individual.

In 26 years of being in the industry I have never once availed of the services of a gym. I used to cycle to work every day and it was great physical exercise and also a chance to clear my mind. In the past year I have attended a counselor and have found it very beneficial, my only regret is that I didn't have the opportunity or wasn't aware of it's benefits 20+ years ago. Helping people identify and deal with issues they are experiencing would be of huge benefit to an organisation.

We've talked about my mental illness and related mental health issues, but I'd be a lot less comfortable talking about it with my new/next manager. During a period when I wasn't doing well, my manager didn't feel like they could ask about how I was doing, or about what kind of support would be helpful. They were relieved when I (without a direct ask from them) let them know that I was not actively suicidal. They talked through some options with me, and expressed that it would be okay for me to take a leave-of-absence for a mental illness (with proper documentation). 

I navigated setting up intermittent FMLA leave on my own, with the LOA company that our company outsources all LOA-related info to. Several months into this, my manager and my future manager let me know that HR is hustling to make an intermittent-LOA policy because no one else in the company of 10,000+ people has ever taken FMLA leave on an intermittent basis. I let them know that $outsource_company has been tracking my leave, and that they had no problems setting it up under the existing FMLA policies. 

I'm seriously considering negotiating down to part time work because I don't want to spend my energy navigating the medical/legal parts of the healthcare/leave system. I'd rather get paid for the work I can do well then fight for accommodation., I've discussed mental illness with coworkers not in my business unit whom I have a primarily social relationship with. Even then I speak in very vague terms (""I'm not doing great this week"", ""have some mental health stuff going on""). One of the coworkers I play board games with during lunch on Fridays has expressed concern when I'm not in the office for board games or for the weekly catered lunch. 

They've been supportive, but also had the deer-in-headlights ""I have no clue what to say here"" look that makes me hesitant to share in the future. 

I'm not comfortable sharing information about my mental health with the folks I work with on a daily basis., This was in a residential youth camp, and it was important for the folks working directly with me to know that I had an anxiety disorder that was (at the time) fairly well managed. When I told my co-facilitator about my asthma, I'd also fill them in on the basics of my anxiety, and how both of those things could affect my ability to function optimally., reduce stigma. offer options for part time work. not use an EAP as their only mental health coverage., I've had to drive all of the progress in mental health insurance coverage at my workplace. Before I joined they only offer short term EAP help (designed for grief or a stressful event), and did not offer coverage for an ongoing mental illness. My office visit was in network if I saw a doctor without a MH specialty to prescribe my medication, but was out-of network if I saw a psychiatrist or other provider who specialized in mental health"
