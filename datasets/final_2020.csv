He is also a friend outside of work so I felt comfortable telling him that I sometimes have a few days or even a week where it can be difficult to get through the day due to depression and anxiety.

He said to let him know if there is ever anything he can do to help, whether that means scheduling regular mental health days, taking longer or more frequent breaks, or even just talking. He also made it clear that there would be no questions asked nor judgement passed were I to do any of those things.

It was the first time I had ever discussed my mental health with an employer. Yes, he is also a friend, but in that moment he was my manager and he was doing an amazing job., I have become increasingly emboldened to discuss my mental health due to the positive and supportive culture in my company. It is difficult.

I used to make regular excuses for not attending social events or for bailing on plans, but at some point I decided to disclose to a couple of close work friends that usually I am just feeling depressed and need to recharge.

They responded with genuine concern and understanding without bombarding me with questions. They really helped normalize the whole experience.

I've since opened up to even more of my coworkers and each time it becomes a little easier and feels a little lighter., I've observed coworkers making negative comments about another coworker due to his sometimes erratic mood, which I know to be due to his mental health issues., Explicitly state that mental health issues present as valid a reason for taking a sick day as physical health issues.

Just talk about it in a way that recognizes the issue without forcing people to disclose their own struggles.

Make a clear statement in the companies mission statement, employee handbook, etc. that mental health is taken seriously and is a priority."

That flexibility allowed me to be productive in an asynchronous way for my employers and colleagues. I can take a nap or a walk when my brain tells me to, without giving explications or excuses, just focusing on productivity and health. 

The covid crisis brought us millions of people with mental issues that will not be treated as required.  However, the increase of workers that could also work from home in asynchronous ways creates space for solutions that could compensate.

I think that it is important to speak openly on those issues; to educate people on first aid solutions. People should be able to take care of little scratches and to recognize situations where professional aid is required."

Then in 1-1 with him I discussed about the same. He reacted wisely and asked to take my own time and relax. But at the same time he continued doing same things. So I has to put resignation there., I was feeling overworked, sick due to a long strategic project on which I was working at the same time I was going through domestic voilence, so I discussed this with one of my collegue and close friend, She was sympathetic to me and tried to be with me more during those days., One of the example is a team member who was not able to work at all, coming late and then I discussed the same with his and he told he had a break up and he is not able to move on. He was in such situation where he was not even ready to go for vacation/ break. So I suggested him to joing some hobby classes and gym and he felt better in sometime., People make the person relize that again and again that he is suffering. And at the back lot of gossip happens. That person will not get good project, pay hike etc or may be put on PIP, In tech industry the mental health is better than other. Half of the mental issues come up due to over expectation from current job  and salary and rest is personal [family] issues. This industry want everything in a person great tech knowledge, communication, Personality wheras most of the people have 1 one those.

I absolutely can't complain. They make me feel safer and able to tackle whatever it comes., I have only talked about it with close coworkers, people I feel very comfortable with. They reaction was good and understanding. However, I wouldn't talk about mental issues with any peer., I think sometimes it can be hard. We work long hourse and people are often very competitive, which might led to a toxic workspace. I think companies should have a culture which prevents this, starting from the VPs and Directors. This means toxic people won't be hired or prometed to positions where soft skills are a must."

I was able to mention this in the stand-up we do every morning, and at that moment I got some help from our coach, but also we started to have the coffee and Friday afternoon chats on our meeting platform., The co-worker in question had some anxiety issues with the team the person was in. That was the moment that person was able to talk with me. 

We talked about the issues the person was having, and later the person thanked me for listening, and decided to take a position in a team that was not toxic., My previous employer was a bit of a special case, it was a small e-commerce company with about 15 people working in it.

At some point the company itself was having a very toxic atmosphere created by some of the co-workers working with me.

I started discussing the issues I had with a co-worker and we were both relieved that we shared some of the issues that we saw. Unfortunately we couldn't change much of the company, so we decided both on different times that we had to leave the company itself., We had a co-worker at my previous workplace that has Asperger, so the person had to sit alone to not have to many impulses from outside.

However this person was always spoken of as if the person was different and wouldn't be able to deliver., The first thing is to make any person on what level in the company feeling safe to open up about the issues the person is facing.

In the teams I've been working at our current company we do try to make the team as safe as possible so that anybody will be able to open up and discuss the issues they're facing."
