Employers can assist folks with resources, but employees are accountable for accessing those resources to keep themselves healthy enough to perform their job functions. If these resources aren't enough, then employees need to feel comfortable moving on to more accommodating arrangements for themselves.

I didn't do this until I knew that I was in a welcoming, supportive environment and my boss, who is the owner of the company, sets the tone himself by being a supportive, open person when it comes to those things like taking time to go to therapy or do other things that help them with mental health like meditate, exercise, or engage in other therapeutic activities (i.e. reiki, drawing, photography classes). People at my company talk openly about going to therapy (""I'm leaving at 5:00 today to go to therapy"" or ""I talked with my therapist about being more open to public speaking and that's something we're working on"") and there isn't any consequence to leaving for those kind of appointments  , I've talked with my coworkers about my mental health on more than one occasion. I try to be intentional and considerate when I have those conversations because it puts some emotional burden on them to hear it and because it is always a risk, even in a supportive environment. Has to be the right person at the right time and sometimes I worry I overshare. But my anxiety symptoms are evident in my work and I think it helps others to know I am self-aware and am working on those issues. I think my coworkers have always been supportive and understanding., I had a coworker share with my their struggles with anxiety via Slack. This was after hours and we were the only ones in the office.  I felt very honored that this person would share this info with me. I do not know if this person shared this info with me because I had been open with them first or if they have shared this info with others. Oh, also since I speak openly about therapy, other employees have privately asked me - often via slack, how to find a therapist or how our mental health benefits work.  (My therapist doesn't take insurance, so...), It was a long time ago, but I had a coworker that I became close with after some time working together and we had casual conversations about mental health -- esp about therapy, therapists, things that work, things that didn't work., I had many informal, personal conversations with one coworker -- they are my BF now, ten years later - about mental health because we had a lot in common. We talked about their complex mental health issues, including borderline personality disorder, and I helped them find a psychiatrist.  All of this happened naturally, organically, and only after the establishment of trust., A coworker disclosed that they had ADHD when their cubicle was moved to a very busy and loud area of the office.  They had difficulty concentrating with the commotion around them and disclosed their ADHD (oh, totally forgot to mention this person when I talked about mental healthy convos with coworkers, anyway) to the employer and they rejected her request for an accommodation (a move to a quieter spot in the office) until they rephrased their request in formal, written terms that belied that they knew that the employer could be in violation of ADA by not accommodating them. After the accommodation was made, this person was labeled a trouble-maker by the executive staff and a careful, strategic effort was made to push this person out. Their title and job description were changed and they were soon put on a performance plan when in the past they had received only positive reviews. They saw the writing on the wall and found employment elsewhere.  This person has recently received a lot of visibility for their success - they also now work remotely - so this is very much a success is the best revenge story. STILL., Industry: Actively work to replace the stereotype of a developer - you know the one, the stereotype is that a programmer doesn't need sleep, can live off of Soylent or Doritos and Mountain Dew, can execute bug-free code for like days on end without getting up from their desk - with one that is more humane. Programmers are people, jeesh.  Employers:  Don't be assholes., I think I gave the tech sector 3 stars for dealing with mental illness, but I came to tech from the nonprofit sector and I would give them 1 star and that would be generous.

The conversation's purpose was definitely to vent - she and I both shared similar feelings, and were able to confide in one another in a meaningful way. , See answer to letter O., My colleague was experiencing work burnout due to a number of factors (we had very high expectations when it came to work output, and the job demanded a fair amount of travel). When she expressed this feeling of burnout, her options to mitigate the problem were pretty limited - take on less work (and get paid less, since we were contractors), or forfeit her contract, neither of which were viable options considering she was the sole breadwinner between her and her husband. She ended up grinning and bearing with it at a comparably intense level, then became pregnant and eventually quit the job. I suspect that had she received proper support, she would have stayed with the company even during her pregnancy. , I think the first step is acknowledging mental health as a priority in the tech community. In this industry, there's huge emphasis placed on output of information, data, and tangible results - often at the expense of the employees actually producing these results. Recognition and acknowledgment on a real, fundamental level would do a lot to change companies' stances on mental health. "

The reactions were generally accepting and positive. Contextually, we both work on the community team and it was during travel and not official ""work"" time., This was during the same conversation sharing our own experiences, The only event that comes to mind is a previous co-worker talking about their inability to believe that depression is a thing. It was hard for me to understand their stance. 

There may have been other circumstances but I do not recall them at this time., I think slowly restoring the ""self-care"" time of employees is a big first step. Having the ability to disconnect from being responsible 24/7 for the health and wellbeing of a computer service is important. And not just on scheduled vacation times, but regularly and generally as a rule. 

The best thing I've gotten is being in a results-based work flow. I'm not required to be at work at a time, but to get work done. This allows me to have my own Self-Care moments or days without worrying about not being ""there"" for work., Overall, I think I am well accepted at the place I work now, but that it is a rare place in the startup world and in the world in general. I'd be much more comfortable talking to this workplace about mental health issues than any other workplace so far. Previous work places includeded US Government, Metal (like steel/aluminum) company, and a small business. Being on a ""community"" team could affect that as well. 

I don't know if that's an indication of changes in the tech industry or a microcosm, but probably worth mentioning."

They later threw it in my face when I decided to quit and used my past honesty to insult me., I became close enough to consider some of my past coworkers friends. I was able to open up to them about medications I was taking, seeing a therapist, and the struggles I was going through. These friends were very supportive, some ended up asking for advice about getting their own therapy. It was really a relief to have people I could trust and be honest with at work, if I was feeling extra bad on some days., One coworker used to tell me about his experiences with anxiety-- we considered each others friends by this time. Another former manager who moved into another department opened up about his recovery from addiction, which allowed me to speak to him about my own experience. It was helpful to have someone at work who could understand me in that regard., One manager at a previous job opened up to me about being in recovery from alcoholism/addiction, and so I opened up to them about it. Unfortunately, this first manager moved into another department and I got a new manager. I decided to be open with the new manager both about my recovery status and having major depression. At first they were supportive. Then, when I decided to quit, they said a lot of extremely hurtful things including calling me lazy, saying that I wanted people to hold my hand, and many condescending comments such as ""Are you sure you should really quit your job right now with your 'condition'?"" all which essentially resulted in gaslighting, since they tried to refute every reason I listed for quitting by saying it was all my fault., State explicit support for taking sick days for mental health issues. State explicit support for employees who are dealing with mental health issues and say that they are just as important as physical health issues. Offer health insurance plans that subsidize or cover mental health. Be more aware of addiction/alcoholism recovery and be more sensitive/sensible with work events., In germany at least, compared to the USA, doctors notes are extremely respected and must be accepted for days off. The employer never knows the reason for the doctor's note and they can't force employees to work. I used to live in the USA and always had a hard time getting sick days at all, and worrying about the reason was a major source of stress. It's at least easier to take mental health days discreetly in Germany, which adds a lot of comfort to my life."

Work medical leave into scheduling. Work sick days into scheduling. Encourage people to talk about how they navigate their tendencies in order to ease into discussions about navigating and mitigating disorders., The greatest point of stress in managing people with mental health issues is managing up.

Ultimately, anyone who's not pulling their weight is a liability. If someone's health, physical or mental, is impacting the business's ability to survive, when should the business sever the relationship?

Moreover, when does extreme productivity that turns into burnout become exploitative? I want to see more discussion and safeguards around that. I'm a workaholic that has realized that I've relapsed and I can't shake it because I've overcommitted. I'm able but it's going to take a toll on me, physically and mentally, until the crunch is over.

However, it was not something either of us discussed openly and it was only by accident that we learned of each other., See above. :), There needs to be more education. Tech work is extremely mentally taxing and in the same sense that athletes are more likely to sustain physical injuries, tech workers are more likely to sustain mental injuries. While we can strive to avoid this, I think it's an unavoidable part of the work.

Talking about this openly goes a long way to helping - but also providing at work support. Could you imagine if when a athlete was injured they had to outsource all support and treatment of that injury?

I understand not all employers have the resources to provide in house support groups, but these employers should be aware of community resources and be encouraging their employees to take advantage of the resources. Lead by example. Mentally healthy supervisors help foster mentally healthy employees."

Perhaps if employers were required by law to provide this benefit some others would take advantage of it. I think the harder issue is helping people see that it's ok to accept help, and get treatment. No one would say you are weak for getting a broken leg treated, but some think those with mental disorders just need to get over it., It's only as I've gotten older that I'm accepted that help is required for some (if not all) things in life and there is no shame in leaning on others. I felt relieved when I found out others in my life had similar mental health issues as I do.

At first, I think they expected to me to fit into the ""neuro-typical"" mold after starting treatment, but that wasn't meant to be. I sent my supervisor a variety of articles explaining ADHD and how it would affect me at work. Over a couple of years, I think they've accepted that I won't be normal. There's still an expectation that my performance is on par as my coworkers and that I won't use my ADHD as a crutch, but I'm allowed to use coping mechanisms to help me succeed., The coworkers I've told have been understanding. They haven't vocalized their opinions or reactions.  I think they might have paused a moment after I explained it, but they haven't treated me any differently., We both suffer from anxiety, so it was more of a conversation of us relating to each other and mental blocks we encounter because of it., My supervisor is old-fashioned and sways towards conservative beliefs. After I revealed that I was diagnosed with ADHD and was receiving treatment, I think she expected that I would become a stereotypical, normal employee who did not have a mental disorder. I would still make the same mistakes that I had before receiving treatment, though to a lesser frequency, however I feel that I received a harsher reaction/consequence than before. I made an effort to educate what my supervisor could expect of me, and discussed with her things that she would still expect of me. Between therapy and developing some coping mechanisms, I like to think I've become a successful employee., Be considerate in regards to an employee's mental health. Be willing to accommodate an employee's requests to enable them to succeed in their position. Forgive the employee if they happen to make a mistake that can be related to their illness, but don't give them a free pass either. The employer should expect the employee to be successful in their position, but accept that the employee may do things differently than they would expect to achieve that success. Lastly, the employee and employer must understand that pills don't teach skills., I revealed my ADHD diagnosis to my supervisor and boss shortly after I received the diagnosis. It wasn't until months after that I read that most employees don't discuss their mental health with their superiors. I'm not sure if I regret discussing my mental health with my superiors. Taking into account their upbringing, and the area that I live in which is more traditional/conservative, I would think that I would have regretted it. But, I've strove to be an advocate for mental health, and strove to help reduce the stigma associated with mental issues, and strove to help people accept and understand that mental issues are real and not trivial. I like to think that I've helped my superiors become more willing to accept my differences (and hopefully others'), and find the unique values that an ADHD brain can bring."

He said yes, and we now have open communication about my illness and he allows me some ""exceptions"" from rules. Such as I have more flexible work hours, and I can work from home when I need to. I can take ""anxiety days"" when I need to. I do take them unpaid since that gives me less anxiety and then it doesn't show on the budget higher up (A large company has a small office in my country and these are all arrangements at that office.) but he is fine with me taking them as paid sick days, again my choice not to do so. All I have to do is inform my team when I'm showing up very late or not at all or working from home, it is such a relief to be able to have honest open communication and has lessened a lot of anxiety that I had about ""being sick a lot"" or if they thought I was a lazy person. My anxiety also affects my sleep a lot and now since making these adjustments I have not had to show up for work unslept and the even though I have fewer hours some weeks then I did before they are more productive and I'm happier about them. He did ask a lot about if there was anything at work that was making things worse and what they could do better, and when they were changing up teams at my office I was asked before anything was finalized., They are too many to describe. Every day that I will work from home, or show up late or not at all because of my mental illness I let my team know. They are all very kind, thoughtful and understanding. 
I have definitely mentioned my illness to other coworkers in a context not related to work, but I'm pretty ""out"" about it in general and want to do my part to eliminate stigma., Really just in passing a few times, no particular reaction., I think putting people in ""one size fits all"" environment to work in is suboptimal. Sure the 9-5 works for some people but as far as for me personally an employer is getting way less value out of me as an employee if I were to be forced to work that way - and most employers don't like suboptimal investments. 
I think open communication is also a big thing. Making sure the people that work for you know that it is okay if they have a mental illness, it made my anxiety way worse to worry about it. 
If there were actual protocols about mental illness at work. When I started work, I knew exactly what to do if I got sick, how many sick days I had and who I had to notify. , You are responsible for your own healthcare in my country, your employer has nothing to do with it. "

An open question... First of all, sorry, English is not my main language, so please bare with me. I work in an IT consulting firm and I faced 2 burnouts, clients were to blame every-time because they were looking for code monkeys instead of software crafts·men·women that care a  about quality (the vast majority of my coworkers). My company was supportive, I had the time to put myself back together but no real solution was found (yet) to prevent consultants to be appointed to unhealthy environments. But they are working on it. In France, it's called occupational stress prevention (prévention des risques psychosociaux), many people here fell very uneasy about the term mental health, to be honest, I really don't know what to do to raise awareness about this issue. , It was a mixed bag. We all react differently to oppression (that lead to depression) in the workplace. Some said to me to ""man up"" some others were compassionate. I described my experiences and detailed the many defence mechanisms I developed over the years to fight against unhealthy behaviours. Oppression, alienation at work, sexism, lack of quality in our craft, lack of empathy, rejected ideas for unfair and political reasons and so on. Politics is everywhere nowadays, I believe that everyone is politically engaged and it's hard to find a common ground that allow us to move forward., One of my coworker faced the same issue as me back then, I was alerted by my human resource manager to help him out. I was grateful to be part of that process and I believe I helped him to recover a bit. We discussed about the gap that exist between the corporate culture of the client he was working with and his desire as a software craftsman. I told him that it wasn't his fault, that he was doing what felt right to him, but his arguments was falling on deaf ears, they weren't interested about his expertise, they just wanted a mindless robot that can work tirelessly without asking too much questions.
