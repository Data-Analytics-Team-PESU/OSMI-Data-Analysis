I am incredibly lucky., Someone was more timid than others as a result of some social anxiety. This person was male and ridiculed relentlessly., Be into it at all. Tech companies jump at the chance to participate in drinking events but mental health events are not considered. Also, conferences and meetups could be less alcohol focused. People who take medication for a disorder or who are in recovery cannot drink; we are woefully forgetful of this fact. Consider offering sparkling cider and other non-alcoholic, non-water beverages at your next meetup.

Very few companies offer employees time during work hours to take care of personal things. Most doctors do not work outside business hours, it is hard to go to therapy and have a full time job."

My experience has been that employers are unwilling to differentiate between the performance impacts of mental health issues and other causes of low productivity. This leads to punishment and shaming, even when the company espouses support for sufferers. I think companies could focus more on what people have to offer, helping find good fit positions, and understanding that those with mental health issues will often have a more cyclical pattern of productivity than others."

Stop expecting unrealistic deadlines and hound them to finish. Fear driven development leads to triggering these mental episodes. People with a disorder want and can function Ina. Work environment. But there has to be proper training and awareness for this in the workplace to be mindful.

In retrospect, I think I suffered from some post-partum anxiety and post-partum depression after the birth of my first child. My leave was pretty short (6 weeks) and after 10 weeks when I would literally be crying at standup half the time, I was told I wasn't ramping up fast enough. I was the first woman on the team and the only mom that had ever been on the team, and honestly, because it was my first, I did not fully realize the extent of the post-partum issues, but there was also no support or recognition for them and, in fact, the additional pressure placed on me probably drove me into a worse spot for a little less than a year before I could think more clearly, recognize what was happening, etc., I think this depends on the company. My former company(ies) were pretty bad. My current company is excellent. We have a mental health channel in slack, mental health benefits are often and openly discussed, both in-patient and out-patient services. Folks are encouraged to take mental health days if necessary and encouraged to discuss what they're going through with others. That being said, the company is facing a tough financial time so recently, the encouragement to take PTO, etc. has decreased and stress level has increased., It was a little difficult for me to answer some of the questions related to mental health disorders because something like post-partum related issues are often for a short period of time so it's not a lifelong depression or something you struggle with all the time, but it is a huge mental health issue (and something that's generally not covered by insurance making it even more difficult to provide resources for)."

I also felt we weren't doing enough to promote mental wellness, especially bc the company prides itself on being a great place to work with tons of benefits. I addressed it with them in summer 2015. No action was taken for the 2016 or 2017 plan year. But for 2018 they are offering a PPO and an interest-free loan for low earners who are concerned with cash flow for the HDHP plan., I have multiple mental disorders and am very open about it in hopes of normalizing them. Everyone has been receptive and this has also encouraged others to discuss issues. But some people without mental disorders act like there's no stigma anymore and that it shouldn't be a big deal to talk about., They told me they had similar experiences that I had spoken about and were looking for guidance and connection., Previous workplace: not being checked in with when red flags come up, not being allowed to take mental wellness days, mocked for bringing the idea up and seen as unable to deal with stress., Educate employees about mental health and what wellness looks like. Encourage them to regularly check in with themselves and maybe complete self-assessments so they can notice if they're not doing well. Encourage open discussion about the topic to normalize it and make it easier to discuss with managers. Encourage people to take mental health days and respond positively when they say they need to."

Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation. Additionally, between the Project Manager and my manager, we ensured there weren't too many tickets assigned in my backlog as well, to reduce the sense of an unending series of tasks piling up., Just identified that I knew I was going through a phase of depression, and that I appreciated that they were reacting kindly despite my terrible attitude, A very long and difficult depression episode led to me dropping down to 50% time for a few months while I worked my way through it"

I've worked for companies where you are expected to leave your problems outside the door of the office.  I've worked for companies who want their employees to bring their whole selves to work.  To be very general my experiences are that the larger/older companies who in the past did not emphasize employee mental health as part of their company values have harder time supporting mental health than smaller/newer companies. The idea that mental health and work life balance should be protected and encouraged by employers is a relatively new thing (at least it seems that way to me).  I feel like the smaller or newer the company the easier it is to create the infrastructure to support employee mental health.  , For context I have worked for 3 different tech companies. 2 of them were companies that could be labeled as being more traditionally corporate and my current employer began as a startup and has only in the past 3 or 4 years grown into a larger/stable company.

He doesn't always understand but he always believes me. He has made several requests on my behalf for accommodations that have been ignored across the board.

They have for the most part been understanding of that. 
There was a time when the department head (VP of Engineering) called me out in our team Slack for having ""problems"" with noise/etc and offering me first choice of seating (changing the office layout). That was then ignored by a few of my coworkers, which prompted the VPE to make an issue of it directly in the office. All I could do was stare at the floor. I felt humiliated and ashamed, particularly that he felt he knew enough about me, without ever having spoken with me, to feel comfortable doing all of that to ""help"" me., This has most often been a discussion as I would have between friends. Even though we work together, coworkers are often much less formal than management. That makes them more likely to share personal stories., The previous VP Engineering was himself familiar with mental health issues and was open and understanding.

My manager was incredibly understanding, and offered me the option to pause any conversations about my professional growth until I was ready to have them. in short, she allowed me to make the decision to ""lean out"" rather than ""lean in"" without any fear of repercussion so I could focus on my mental health, and then return to conversations about how to grow professionally once I decided I was ready., A coworker and I both struggle with chronic anxiety, and I talked with her a lot right around the time I was starting to go to therapy. She discussed her own experiences with being in therapy for years, and really helped normalize the whole process for me., A manager described a issue she had experienced with disordered eating while she was in college., Call out health benefits and treatment options as a part of the benefits package during onboarding, and repeat this option throughout the year (how can employees take advantage of a benefit that's never discussed?). We should discuss mental health in the same straightforward way we discuss physical health. Talk openly about how mental health, stress reduction, and work life balance are a priority for the company, and then follow through with action. Provide multiple healthcare plans so that employees with mental health issues can choose the plan that's right for them--for instance, a low to middle income employee with a high deductible healthcare plan might find seeing a therapist to be a financial burden if they have not yet hit their deductible, thereby preventing them from going to therapy at all."

It could be greatly improved by socializing the availability of benefits and resources throughout the year--especially around holidays when lots of folks struggle., I thinka lot of people ""grin and bear it"". I've followed what OSMH has been doing with interest because it seems so obvious and so right. It also occurs to me that the stigma will take a generation to work through. It's going to be a long road to get from starting a conversation at work to acceptance."

In many cases, people in other fields, through TV/sitcoms movies, etc., have been exposed to the higher incidence rates for certain issues in the tech industry, but mainly as a source of humor.  The tech industry should show that some of these issues can actually be pulled on as a source of strength, both as the direct result of the issue (say, hyper-focus perhaps) or through the strength of character that is cultivated in learning to overcome these issues/challenges.  , For classification purposes - I am a mid-40's male, with diagnosed anxiety and ADD.

If these resources aren't enough, then employees need to feel comfortable moving on to more accommodating arrangements for themselves. Employers aren't medical care givers, as an employee I would not want them to be, and employment arrangements must be mutually beneficial., Ideally all of the arrangements for a person's health will be removed from the employer - employee relationship.

I didn't do this until I knew that I was in a welcoming, supportive environment and my boss, who is the owner of the company, sets the tone himself by being a supportive, open person when it comes to those things like taking time to go to therapy or do other things that help them with mental health like meditate, exercise, or engage in other therapeutic activities (i.e. reiki, drawing, photography classes). People at my company talk openly about going to therapy (""I'm leaving at 5:00 today to go to therapy"" or ""I talked with my therapist about being more open to public speaking and that's something we're working on"") and there isn't any consequence to leaving for those kind of appointments  , I've talked with my coworkers about my mental health on more than one occasion. I try to be intentional and considerate when I have those conversations because it puts some emotional burden on them to hear it and because it is always a risk, even in a supportive environment. Has to be the right person at the right time and sometimes I worry I overshare. But my anxiety symptoms are evident in my work and I think it helps others to know I am self-aware and am working on those issues. I think my coworkers have always been supportive and understanding., I had a coworker share with my their struggles with anxiety via Slack. This was after hours and we were the only ones in the office.  I felt very honored that this person would share this info with me. I do not know if this person shared this info with me because I had been open with them first or if they have shared this info with others. Oh, also since I speak openly about therapy, other employees have privately asked me - often via slack, how to find a therapist or how our mental health benefits work.  (My therapist doesn't take insurance, so...), It was a long time ago, but I had a coworker that I became close with after some time working together and we had casual conversations about mental health -- esp about therapy, therapists, things that work, things that didn't work., I had many informal, personal conversations with one coworker -- they are my BF now, ten years later - about mental health because we had a lot in common. We talked about their complex mental health issues, including borderline personality disorder, and I helped them find a psychiatrist.  All of this happened naturally, organically, and only after the establishment of trust., A coworker disclosed that they had ADHD when their cubicle was moved to a very busy and loud area of the office.  They had difficulty concentrating with the commotion around them and disclosed their ADHD (oh, totally forgot to mention this person when I talked about mental healthy convos with coworkers, anyway) to the employer and they rejected her request for an accommodation (a move to a quieter spot in the office) until they rephrased their request in formal, written terms that belied that they knew that the employer could be in violation of ADA by not accommodating them. After the accommodation was made, this person was labeled a trouble-maker by the executive staff and a careful, strategic effort was made to push this person out. Their title and job description were changed and they were soon put on a performance plan when in the past they had received only positive reviews. They saw the writing on the wall and found employment elsewhere.  This person has recently received a lot of visibility for their success - they also now work remotely - so this is very much a success is the best revenge story. STILL., Industry: Actively work to replace the stereotype of a developer - you know the one, the stereotype is that a programmer doesn't need sleep, can live off of Soylent or Doritos and Mountain Dew, can execute bug-free code for like days on end without getting up from their desk - with one that is more humane. Programmers are people, jeesh.  Employers:  Don't be assholes., I think I gave the tech sector 3 stars for dealing with mental illness, but I came to tech from the nonprofit sector and I would give them 1 star and that would be generous. Tech is fucking heaven compared to nonprofit work, where remote work is unheard of, benefits and wages are skimpy, and self-sacrifice is the name of the game.  "

I suspect that had she received proper support, she would have stayed with the company even during her pregnancy. , I think the first step is acknowledging mental health as a priority in the tech community. In this industry, there's huge emphasis placed on output of information, data, and tangible results - often at the expense of the employees actually producing these results. Recognition and acknowledgment on a real, fundamental level would do a lot to change companies' stances on mental health. "

The reactions were generally accepting and positive. Contextually, we both work on the community team and it was during travel and not official ""work"" time., This was during the same conversation sharing our own experiences, The only event that comes to mind is a previous co-worker talking about their inability to believe that depression is a thing. It was hard for me to understand their stance. 

There may have been other circumstances but I do not recall them at this time., I think slowly restoring the ""self-care"" time of employees is a big first step. Having the ability to disconnect from being responsible 24/7 for the health and wellbeing of a computer service is important. And not just on scheduled vacation times, but regularly and generally as a rule. 

The best thing I've gotten is being in a results-based work flow. I'm not required to be at work at a time, but to get work done. This allows me to have my own Self-Care moments or days without worrying about not being ""there"" for work., Overall, I think I am well accepted at the place I work now, but that it is a rare place in the startup world and in the world in general. I'd be much more comfortable talking to this workplace about mental health issues than any other workplace so far. Previous work places includeded US Government, Metal (like steel/aluminum) company, and a small business. Being on a ""community"" team could affect that as well. 

I don't know if that's an indication of changes in the tech industry or a microcosm, but probably worth mentioning."

The CEO told me not to worry about it because ""we're all family"" and ""your health is the most important thing."" The manager just stared at me. Two days after my conversation with the CEO, I was ""laid off"" and lost all medical and MH benefits., After a large layoff in 2002, a group of four of us on the same team were affected with MH problems. At least two of us, including myself, have suffered with severe clinical depression ever since then. I have been to PHP and looked into getting experimental ketamine therapy; my friend/coworker became suicidal and underwent six weeks of ECT., See above. We were a miniature support group for one another's MH issues., After I returned from my medical leave to attend PHP, I was shunned by pretty much every staff member at my site. No one would talk with me or even make eye contact with me. I needed support more than ever and my extended team isolated me, increasing the intensity of my symptoms., Acknowledge that MH issues are real and have a profound impact on tech workers who use their brains to work. Depression has blunted my memory to the point where I don't remember simple things (I have any number of Stack Overflow bookmarks). The treatments are often as bad as the diseases. My antianxiety medication makes me fuzzy and apathetic. My friend who had ECT suffered *severe* memory loss and was unable to do her job for several weeks even after she was medically discharged., I have been illegally fired from TWO tech jobs secondary to depression.

Tech work is extremely mentally taxing and in the same sense that athletes are more likely to sustain physical injuries, tech workers are more likely to sustain mental injuries. While we can strive to avoid this, I think it's an unavoidable part of the work.

Talking about this openly goes a long way to helping - but also providing at work support. Could you imagine if when a athlete was injured they had to outsource all support and treatment of that injury?

I understand not all employers have the resources to provide in house support groups, but these employers should be aware of community resources and be encouraging their employees to take advantage of the resources.

They were supportive., I think in general there is a don't ask don't tell attitude. Some will provide some benefit as a token, but I'm not sure they care deeply to help those who want help.  Perhaps if employers were required by law to provide this benefit some others would take advantage of it. I think the harder issue is helping people see that it's ok to accept help, and get treatment. No one would say you are weak for getting a broken leg treated, but some think those with mental disorders just need to get over it., It's only as I've gotten older that I'm accepted that help is required for some (if not all) things in life and there is no shame in leaning on others. I felt relieved when I found out others in my life had similar mental health issues as I do.

At first, I think they expected to me to fit into the ""neuro-typical"" mold after starting treatment, but that wasn't meant to be. I sent my supervisor a variety of articles explaining ADHD and how it would affect me at work. Over a couple of years, I think they've accepted that I won't be normal. There's still an expectation that my performance is on par as my coworkers and that I won't use my ADHD as a crutch, but I'm allowed to use coping mechanisms to help me succeed., The coworkers I've told have been understanding. They haven't vocalized their opinions or reactions.  I think they might have paused a moment after I explained it, but they haven't treated me any differently., We both suffer from anxiety, so it was more of a conversation of us relating to each other and mental blocks we encounter because of it., My supervisor is old-fashioned and sways towards conservative beliefs. After I revealed that I was diagnosed with ADHD and was receiving treatment, I think she expected that I would become a stereotypical, normal employee who did not have a mental disorder. I would still make the same mistakes that I had before receiving treatment, though to a lesser frequency, however I feel that I received a harsher reaction/consequence than before. I made an effort to educate what my supervisor could expect of me, and discussed with her things that she would still expect of me. Between therapy and developing some coping mechanisms, I like to think I've become a successful employee., Be considerate in regards to an employee's mental health. Be willing to accommodate an employee's requests to enable them to succeed in their position. Forgive the employee if they happen to make a mistake that can be related to their illness, but don't give them a free pass either. The employer should expect the employee to be successful in their position, but accept that the employee may do things differently than they would expect to achieve that success. Lastly, the employee and employer must understand that pills don't teach skills., I revealed my ADHD diagnosis to my supervisor and boss shortly after I received the diagnosis. It wasn't until months after that I read that most employees don't discuss their mental health with their superiors. I'm not sure if I regret discussing my mental health with my superiors. Taking into account their upbringing, and the area that I live in which is more traditional/conservative, I would think that I would have regretted it. But, I've strove to be an advocate for mental health, and strove to help reduce the stigma associated with mental issues, and strove to help people accept and understand that mental issues are real and not trivial. I like to think that I've helped my superiors become more willing to accept my differences (and hopefully others'), and find the unique values that an ADHD brain can bring."

He said yes, and we now have open communication about my illness and he allows me some ""exceptions"" from rules. Such as I have more flexible work hours, and I can work from home when I need to. I can take ""anxiety days"" when I need to. I do take them unpaid since that gives me less anxiety and then it doesn't show on the budget higher up (A large company has a small office in my country and these are all arrangements at that office.) but he is fine with me taking them as paid sick days, again my choice not to do so. All I have to do is inform my team when I'm showing up very late or not at all or working from home, it is such a relief to be able to have honest open communication and has lessened a lot of anxiety that I had about ""being sick a lot"" or if they thought I was a lazy person. My anxiety also affects my sleep a lot and now since making these adjustments I have not had to show up for work unslept and the even though I have fewer hours some weeks then I did before they are more productive and I'm happier about them. He did ask a lot about if there was anything at work that was making things worse and what they could do better, and when they were changing up teams at my office I was asked before anything was finalized., They are too many to describe. Every day that I will work from home, or show up late or not at all because of my mental illness I let my team know. They are all very kind, thoughtful and understanding. 
I have definitely mentioned my illness to other coworkers in a context not related to work, but I'm pretty ""out"" about it in general and want to do my part to eliminate stigma., Really just in passing a few times, no particular reaction., I think putting people in ""one size fits all"" environment to work in is suboptimal. Sure the 9-5 works for some people but as far as for me personally an employer is getting way less value out of me as an employee if I were to be forced to work that way - and most employers don't like suboptimal investments. 
I think open communication is also a big thing. Making sure the people that work for you know that it is okay if they have a mental illness, it made my anxiety way worse to worry about it. 
If there were actual protocols about mental illness at work. When I started work, I knew exactly what to do if I got sick, how many sick days I had and who I had to notify. , You are responsible for your own healthcare in my country, your employer has nothing to do with it. "

An open question... First of all, sorry, English is not my main language, so please bare with me. I work in an IT consulting firm and I faced 2 burnouts, clients were to blame every-time because they were looking for code monkeys instead of software crafts·men·women that care a  about quality (the vast majority of my coworkers). My company was supportive, I had the time to put myself back together but no real solution was found (yet) to prevent consultants to be appointed to unhealthy environments. But they are working on it. In France, it's called occupational stress prevention (prévention des risques psychosociaux), many people here fell very uneasy about the term mental health, to be honest, I really don't know what to do to raise awareness about this issue. , It was a mixed bag. We all react differently to oppression (that lead to depression) in the workplace. Some said to me to ""man up"" some others were compassionate. I described my experiences and detailed the many defence mechanisms I developed over the years to fight against unhealthy behaviours. Oppression, alienation at work, sexism, lack of quality in our craft, lack of empathy, rejected ideas for unfair and political reasons and so on. Politics is everywhere nowadays, I believe that everyone is politically engaged and it's hard to find a common ground that allow us to move forward., One of my coworker faced the same issue as me back then, I was alerted by my human resource manager to help him out. I was grateful to be part of that process and I believe I helped him to recover a bit. We discussed about the gap that exist between the corporate culture of the client he was working with and his desire as a software craftsman. I told him that it wasn't his fault, that he was doing what felt right to him, but his arguments was falling on deaf ears, they weren't interested about his expertise, they just wanted a mindless robot that can work tirelessly without asking too much questions. I told him that he was more than competent, that he was not an impostor., The industry need standards to prevent employees from developing mental heath issues, I believe that most of it can be prevented if it shows more consideration for the human condition. We are not machines, we need a sustainable work pace, we cannot be threatened all the time by unrealistic deadlines, a balance need to be found. , Thank you, I really needed this survey.

If your brain is not working properly, how can yo work?

We need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.

So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)

1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.

2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.

3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.

4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness."

My coworkers were all very understanding and it didn’t seem to change their behaviour with me., As I said above, I have a coworker who is having real difficulty coping with anxiety and their work. I have had brief conversations with several other coworkers about this person’s situation, as they are currently getting inpatient treatment for it and I’m the person on the team who knows them best. People are all very sensitive and worried about them. One coworker told me that although he worries about them, he can’t really understand what their troubles are and what they feel like, because he’s never had that experience himself. I considered trying to explain but didn’t think I would be able to., It went horribly. I was a PhD student and disclosed to my supervisors that I was suffering from depression and anxiety but was seeing a therapist and taking steps to feel better. (This was partly related to the poor progress of my project, and their supervision style.) They said they understood but treated me with a very kid-gloves approach for a few weeks, then demanded to ask mu therapist questions about me. Eventually I agreed to let them send their questions to an HR person, who would act as an intermediary between them and the therapist. They wanted to know if I was a danger to myself or others. The therapist replied that I was not. My supervisors then told me that the therapist’s answer showed that my illness was no excuse for the poor state of my project. They put me on a ten-week ‘improvement plan’ that was logically impossible to succeed at, and then pushed me out of the PhD studentship., Please see my answer above to the question about talking to a previous employer about a mental health disorder., Take it as seriously as physical health support."

It was at this point I shared with him the conversations I had with the other two staff members and how I was addressing these gaps with their support.

And then fired me three months later after creating a performance plan that was impossible to complete successfully. , Me to my coworker: something about depression, anxiety, imposter syndrome, feeling inadequate, how it physically manifests itself daily. I feel like this job may kill me.
My coworker, back to me: Oh, yes. That happens to me too (anxiety/depression/imposter syndrome/feeling inadequate).
me back to coworker: Boss dishes out the stress, definitely. Can you imagine the insane amount of stress he's under? Does he ever sleep? , my coworker/good friend was describing how sad she was feeling after several traumatic events in rapid succession and bad turn of events at work. I finally said, ""This is my therapist's number, call her and ask about happy pills. I take them, they help me. I hope they help you too."", Explained to my boss that I had to pause in the middle of a late night deployment because I was physically ill with worry that the deploy was going to break in a spectactular manner and I wouldn't be able to quickly fix it.

The response from my coworker was a lot of ""oh yea, me too""
, Anxiety had taken over, and I could not think straight. I couldn't remember all the extremely different things I needed to know cold for my new job. I had an anxiety attack in front of my boss. 

All this happened AFTER the company I worked for had their annual ""year start"" gathering in SFO. When it became apparent that I have anxiety, and it was interfering with my ability to complete tasks, my boss put me on a PIP that was impossible to achieve. I missed one task that was unclear the first week, and that was grounds enough for them to fire me. They paid me severance, offered me a ""soft landing"".

I now realize getting fired was probably a good thing.  However, at the time I made it clear I was not giving up and admitting defeat. The company I worked for, who champions mental health issues! No stigma! Open discussion! When I broke down and told my boss about my anxiety during a 1:1 and several questions had been posed (the answer to most was ""because of my anxiety""), he probably made the decision right there that he wasn't going to keep me because I was a pain to deal with. , Stop CRUSHING PEOPLE WITH RIDICULOUS DEADLINES!

It came as a complete shock to me to learn that they had been dealing with depression for longer than I had known them (6+ years) and such thoughts were a regular occurrence for them but this was the first time they had acted upon them. If it hadn't been for the intervention of a passerby they would have thrown themselves into the river., A colleague who had just volunteered the fact that they almost ended their life on the way to work was basically told ""Well you're here now so you might as well get on with the job."", Take an active interest in the person and tailor the approach to the needs of the individual.

In 26 years of being in the industry I have never once availed of the services of a gym. I used to cycle to work every day and it was great physical exercise and also a chance to clear my mind. In the past year I have attended a counselor and have found it very beneficial, my only regret is that I didn't have the opportunity or wasn't aware of it's benefits 20+ years ago.

We've talked about my mental illness and related mental health issues, but I'd be a lot less comfortable talking about it with my new/next manager. During a period when I wasn't doing well, my manager didn't feel like they could ask about how I was doing, or about what kind of support would be helpful. They were relieved when I (without a direct ask from them) let them know that I was not actively suicidal. They talked through some options with me, and expressed that it would be okay for me to take a leave-of-absence for a mental illness (with proper documentation). 

I navigated setting up intermittent FMLA leave on my own, with the LOA company that our company outsources all LOA-related info to. Several months into this, my manager and my future manager let me know that HR is hustling to make an intermittent-LOA policy because no one else in the company of 10,000+ people has ever taken FMLA leave on an intermittent basis. I let them know that $outsource_company has been tracking my leave, and that they had no problems setting it up under the existing FMLA policies. 

I'm seriously considering negotiating down to part time work because I don't want to spend my energy navigating the medical/legal parts of the healthcare/leave system. I'd rather get paid for the work I can do well then fight for accommodation., I've discussed mental illness with coworkers not in my business unit whom I have a primarily social relationship with. Even then I speak in very vague terms (""I'm not doing great this week"", ""have some mental health stuff going on""). One of the coworkers I play board games with during lunch on Fridays has expressed concern when I'm not in the office for board games or for the weekly catered lunch. 

They've been supportive, but also had the deer-in-headlights ""I have no clue what to say here"" look that makes me hesitant to share in the future. 

I'm not comfortable sharing information about my mental health with the folks I work with on a daily basis., This was in a residential youth camp, and it was important for the folks working directly with me to know that I had an anxiety disorder that was (at the time) fairly well managed. When I told my co-facilitator about my asthma, I'd also fill them in on the basics of my anxiety, and how both of those things could affect my ability to function optimally., reduce stigma. offer options for part time work. not use an EAP as their only mental health coverage., I've had to drive all of the progress in mental health insurance coverage at my workplace. Before I joined they only offer short term EAP help (designed for grief or a stressful event), and did not offer coverage for an ongoing mental illness. My office visit was in network if I saw a doctor without a MH specialty to prescribe my medication, but was out-of network if I saw a psychiatrist or other provider who specialized in mental health"

He is also a friend outside of work so I felt comfortable telling him that I sometimes have a few days or even a week where it can be difficult to get through the day due to depression and anxiety.

He said to let him know if there is ever anything he can do to help, whether that means scheduling regular mental health days, taking longer or more frequent breaks, or even just talking. He also made it clear that there would be no questions asked nor judgement passed were I to do any of those things.

It was the first time I had ever discussed my mental health with an employer. Yes, he is also a friend, but in that moment he was my manager and he was doing an amazing job., I have become increasingly emboldened to discuss my mental health due to the positive and supportive culture in my company. It is difficult.

I used to make regular excuses for not attending social events or for bailing on plans, but at some point I decided to disclose to a couple of close work friends that usually I am just feeling depressed and need to recharge.

They responded with genuine concern and understanding without bombarding me with questions. They really helped normalize the whole experience.

I've since opened up to even more of my coworkers and each time it becomes a little easier and feels a little lighter., I've observed coworkers making negative comments about another coworker due to his sometimes erratic mood, which I know to be due to his mental health issues., Explicitly state that mental health issues present as valid a reason for taking a sick day as physical health issues.

The covid crisis brought us millions of people with mental issues that will not be treated as required.  However, the increase of workers that could also work from home in asynchronous ways creates space for solutions that could compensate.

I think that it is important to speak openly on those issues; to educate people on first aid solutions. People should be able to take care of little scratches and to recognize situations where professional aid is required."

Unfortunately the counselling itself didn't work, and I chose to join a different circle, where I am myself in a position to help others with some of the issues I had., At the beginning of the pandemic we were all working from home, and I started to feel less motivated, and I felt a bit sombre.
I was able to mention this in the stand-up we do every morning, and at that moment I got some help from our coach, but also we started to have the coffee and Friday afternoon chats on our meeting platform., The co-worker in question had some anxiety issues with the team the person was in. That was the moment that person was able to talk with me. 

We talked about the issues the person was having, and later the person thanked me for listening, and decided to take a position in a team that was not toxic., My previous employer was a bit of a special case, it was a small e-commerce company with about 15 people working in it.

At some point the company itself was having a very toxic atmosphere created by some of the co-workers working with me.

I started discussing the issues I had with a co-worker and we were both relieved that we shared some of the issues that we saw. Unfortunately we couldn't change much of the company, so we decided both on different times that we had to leave the company itself., We had a co-worker at my previous workplace that has Asperger, so the person had to sit alone to not have to many impulses from outside.

However this person was always spoken of as if the person was different and wouldn't be able to deliver., The first thing is to make any person on what level in the company feeling safe to open up about the issues the person is facing.

In the teams I've been working at our current company we do try to make the team as safe as possible so that anybody will be able to open up and discuss the issues they're facing."
