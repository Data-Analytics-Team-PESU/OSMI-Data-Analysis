Tech companies jump at the chance to participate in drinking events but mental health events are not considered. Also, conferences and meetups could be less alcohol focused. People who take medication for a disorder or who are in recovery cannot drink; we are woefully forgetful of this fact. Consider offering sparkling cider and other non-alcoholic, non-water beverages at your next meetup.

Very few companies offer employees time during work hours to take care of personal things. Most doctors do not work outside business hours, it is hard to go to therapy and have a full time job."

This is a large factor in why I left my previous job and am reluctant to discuss my mental health with current coworkers and supervisors., Women who had strong opinions were often a source of speculation from coworkers about what might be wrong with them.

My experience has been that employers are unwilling to differentiate between the performance impacts of mental health issues and other causes of low productivity. This leads to punishment and shaming, even when the company espouses support for sufferers. I think companies could focus more on what people have to offer, helping find good fit positions, and understanding that those with mental health issues will often have a more cyclical pattern of productivity than others."

In retrospect, I think I suffered from some post-partum anxiety and post-partum depression after the birth of my first child. My leave was pretty short (6 weeks) and after 10 weeks when I would literally be crying at standup half the time, I was told I wasn't ramping up fast enough. I was the first woman on the team and the only mom that had ever been on the team, and honestly, because it was my first, I did not fully realize the extent of the post-partum issues, but there was also no support or recognition for them and, in fact, the additional pressure placed on me probably drove me into a worse spot for a little less than a year before I could think more clearly, recognize what was happening, etc., I think this depends on the company. My former company(ies) were pretty bad. My current company is excellent. We have a mental health channel in slack, mental health benefits are often and openly discussed, both in-patient and out-patient services. Folks are encouraged to take mental health days if necessary and encouraged to discuss what they're going through with others. That being said, the company is facing a tough financial time so recently, the encouragement to take PTO, etc. has decreased and stress level has increased., It was a little difficult for me to answer some of the questions related to mental health disorders because something like post-partum related issues are often for a short period of time so it's not a lifelong depression or something you struggle with all the time, but it is a huge mental health issue (and something that's generally not covered by insurance making it even more difficult to provide resources for)."

Only preventive care is covered before the deductible. After the deductible everything is covered 100%. I would rather sign up for a PPO, because even if premiums are higher, it's a commitment to my mental wellness for the year and I don't have to decide if I'm worth it on a weekly basis. I also felt we weren't doing enough to promote mental wellness, especially bc the company prides itself on being a great place to work with tons of benefits. I addressed it with them in summer 2015. No action was taken for the 2016 or 2017 plan year. But for 2018 they are offering a PPO and an interest-free loan for low earners who are concerned with cash flow for the HDHP plan., I have multiple mental disorders and am very open about it in hopes of normalizing them. Everyone has been receptive and this has also encouraged others to discuss issues. But some people without mental disorders act like there's no stigma anymore and that it shouldn't be a big deal to talk about., They told me they had similar experiences that I had spoken about and were looking for guidance and connection., Previous workplace: not being checked in with when red flags come up, not being allowed to take mental wellness days, mocked for bringing the idea up and seen as unable to deal with stress., Educate employees about mental health and what wellness looks like. Encourage them to regularly check in with themselves and maybe complete self-assessments so they can notice if they're not doing well. Encourage open discussion about the topic to normalize it and make it easier to discuss with managers. Encourage people to take mental health days and respond positively when they say they need to."

Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation. Additionally, between the Project Manager and my manager, we ensured there weren't too many tickets assigned in my backlog as well, to reduce the sense of an unending series of tasks piling up., Just identified that I knew I was going through a phase of depression, and that I appreciated that they were reacting kindly despite my terrible attitude, A very long and difficult depression episode led to me dropping down to 50% time for a few months while I worked my way through it"

To be very general my experiences are that the larger/older companies who in the past did not emphasize employee mental health as part of their company values have harder time supporting mental health than smaller/newer companies. The idea that mental health and work life balance should be protected and encouraged by employers is a relatively new thing (at least it seems that way to me).  I feel like the smaller or newer the company the easier it is to create the infrastructure to support employee mental health.  , For context I have worked for 3 different tech companies. 2 of them were companies that could be labeled as being more traditionally corporate and my current employer began as a startup and has only in the past 3 or 4 years grown into a larger/stable company.  My current employer from the creation of the company has emphasized the importance of mental health and those values stayed with the company as we've grown."

There was a time when the department head (VP of Engineering) called me out in our team Slack for having ""problems"" with noise/etc and offering me first choice of seating (changing the office layout). That was then ignored by a few of my coworkers, which prompted the VPE to make an issue of it directly in the office. All I could do was stare at the floor. I felt humiliated and ashamed, particularly that he felt he knew enough about me, without ever having spoken with me, to feel comfortable doing all of that to ""help"" me., This has most often been a discussion as I would have between friends. Even though we work together, coworkers are often much less formal than management. That makes them more likely to share personal stories., The previous VP Engineering was himself familiar with mental health issues and was open and understanding. I brought up my anxiety and he did what he could to help, including arranging a space for me at work that would eliminate distractions and interruptions., My supervisor made multiple requests for small accommodations that weren't only denied but ignored completely.
My VP of Engineering called me out in the team Slack for having problems with noise, then in person in the office., I think the tech *community* is at least more aware of it than other industries with which I am familiar."

She discussed her own experiences with being in therapy for years, and really helped normalize the whole process for me., A manager described a issue she had experienced with disordered eating while she was in college., Call out health benefits and treatment options as a part of the benefits package during onboarding, and repeat this option throughout the year (how can employees take advantage of a benefit that's never discussed?). We should discuss mental health in the same straightforward way we discuss physical health. Talk openly about how mental health, stress reduction, and work life balance are a priority for the company, and then follow through with action. Provide multiple healthcare plans so that employees with mental health issues can choose the plan that's right for them--for instance, a low to middle income employee with a high deductible healthcare plan might find seeing a therapist to be a financial burden if they have not yet hit their deductible, thereby preventing them from going to therapy at all."
