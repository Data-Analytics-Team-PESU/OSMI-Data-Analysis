# Analysis of the Evolution of Tech Workplace Disposition toward Mental Health
*Data Analysis on the OSMI Survey Datasets*

### About the Datasets
OSMI is a non-profit organization dedicated to raising awareness about mental health and wellness in tech and open source communities. It is responsible for collecting a repository of data sets, one for each year since 2014, regarding mental health in the tech workplace. We look to aggregate all these datasets to analyze overarching trends regarding mental health attitudes in the workplace throughout the years.

### Problem Statements for Analysis
We look to analyze how the OSMI datasets ranging from the years 2014-2020 encapsulate the trend of employer acceptance of mental health and initiatives to tackle
employee mental health. We also delve into: 
- the variation of employee attitudes towards sharing their issues with their employers,
- how this attitude correlates to the inclination of employees to get treated, and 
- how this attitude correlates with employer initiatives.
