# Evolution of Tech Workplace Disposition toward Mental Health
*Data Analysis on the OSMI Survey Datasets*

### About the Datasets
The non-profit organization, [OSMI](https://osmihelp.org/) is involved in raising awareness and providing resources to support mental health and wellness in tech and open source communities. It has contributed to the public a repository of datasets, collected throughout the years since 2014 through questionnaires. We look to aggregate these datasets to analyze overarching trends regarding attitudes and perception of mental health in the workplace throughout the years.

Sources for the datasets: 
1. [Research from OSMI](https://osmihelp.org/research)
2. [Kaggle Repositories for the OSMI Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)

### Problem Statements for Analysis
We look to analyze how the OSMI datasets ranging from the years 2014-2020 encapsulate the trend of employer acceptance of mental health and initiatives to tackle
employee mental health. We also delve into: 
- the variation of employee attitudes towards sharing their issues with their employers,
- how this attitude correlates to the inclination of employees to get treated, and 
- how this attitude correlates with employer initiatives.
