On the publicly available survey webpage, all the questions asked are followed by a distribution of the responses. We scrape data about the questions for merging with the Kaggle dataset for each year's survey. To scrape the questions of its online surveys, we use the ```requests``` and ```BeautifulSoup``` libraries. In order to acquire the responses of each participant, we use the dataset on Kaggle.\n",
